avr-evtd (1.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Please, note that as of version 1.7.4-1, avr-evtd has changed its
  binary names and related directories from avr_evtd to avr-evtd.
  In particular, the configuration from /etc/avr_evtd should be
  read and migrated to /etc/avr-evtd if the defaults are not the
  desired values.
